x86_64 assembly examples.

## Tools

These snippets are written for Windows with AT&T syntax. I'm building
it with GCC from MingW. Each example has instructions on how to build
and run them, but your mileage may vary depending on your system.

To get syntax highlighting in the x86 files I use SublimeText 3 with
the x86_64 assembly package from 13xforever.

## Disclaimer

I'm writing these to learn. Code may be suboptimal and not according
to best practices.
